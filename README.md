# books

Automatic cropping tool for cropping to books

## Build

### Linux

This project uses the meson build system:

```
$ meson build
$ cd build
$ ninja
$ sudo ninja install
```

### Windows
Since this project uses GTK4, it's a bit difficult here (there's no GTK4 installer for Win32 just yet). However, I have built using cygwin & it seems to work ok.
